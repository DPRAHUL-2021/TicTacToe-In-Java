# Java TicTacToe

This is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game in Java, playable in the console. Two players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the board is full resulting in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source file (`TicTacToe.java`) using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled Java program to start the game.
4. Players take turns entering row and column numbers to mark their move on the grid.
5. The game ends when one player wins or when the board is full.

## Features

- Simple console-based interface for easy gameplay.
- Win detection algorithm checks for three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- Board status is displayed after each move.
- Supports two-player gameplay.

## Usage

Compile the code using any Java compiler:

```bash
javac TicTacToe.java
```

Run the compiled program:

```bash
java TicTacToe
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
